I would like to introduce a new fork of the popular generative neural network **Fooocus - Fooocus extend**. 
I would like to point out that this fork can be run both locally on your computer and via Google Colab. 
Let's look at everything in order. 

**Launch**. If you will run it on a local machine, you can safely skip this item.
   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468487b8-8d4e-454c-ba92-1c9e5b60feb7)

Before launching you are offered to choose the following settings
Fooocus Profile - select which profile will be loaded at startup (default, anime, realistic).
Fooocus Theme - select a theme - light or dark.
Tunnel - select launch tunnel. When it happens that gradio stops working for some reason, you can choose cloudflared tunnel. However, the generation is a bit slower
Memory patch - adds a few keys to the launch bar that allow you to optimise your graphics card if you are using the free version of Google Colab. If you have paid access, this item can be disabled
GoogleDrive output - connects your GoogleDisk and save all of your generation directly to it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323f6311-bbb4-477f-860d-3cfecae5d89b)

The **“Extensions”** panel is divided into three groups:
- in generation - modules working during generation
- modules - generation modules
- tools - auxiliary tools

**“in generation”** panel

**Prompt Translate**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ddff3b1-5e98-43d4-b102-b61176c40c84)


Allows to translate both positive and negative prompts from any language into English, both before generation and directly during generation.

**InstantID** (works only in the local version) 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f12b7389-48b4-4659-a94d-5d01268ab179)

The module allows you to generate an image with a reference face
Upload a photo of your face - your reference face should be uploaded here.

Upload a reference pose image (Optional) - a reference pose image will be uploaded here. Optional.

Pregeneration image - if this mode is enabled, then a new image will be generated as a reference pose image based on your Prompt.

If you have not specified a pose reference image, an image will be generated from your prompt based only on the face image and the same resolution. 

If a pose reference image is present, the dimensions will be the same as the pose reference image.

IdentityNet strength (for fidelity) - responsible for the accuracy of face repetition.

Image adapter strength (for detail) - responsible for details

ContrloNet
- canny - used to define image contours
- depth - used to create a depth map of the image
Schedulers - select the Schedulers that will be used when generating the image with our face.
Enhance non-face region - enhance non-face parts of the image

**Unlike conventional generation, this 30-step generation takes about 7 minutes. It requires a video card with 12GB minimum.**

**Inswapper**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3399327d-0fe4-46cc-8f34-430e94ab7910)

This module is also intended for face replacement.

Source Image Index - index of the face in the reference image. Faces are numbered from left to right from top to bottom starting from zero. If you specify -1, the average mixed face of all available faces will be taken as the reference face

Target Image Index - index of the face in the output image. This is the index of the face to be replaced in the output image. If you specify -1, all faces will be replaced.

Source Face Image - image with face

**CodeFormer**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512eb538-1923-439d-ad2a-826d7594e49e)

Face enhancement module with upscale capability

Pre_Face_Align - aligns the face if it is tilted

Background Enchanced - improve background quality

Face Upsample - adjust reference face to the size of the input image face

Upscale - image enlargement

Codeformer_Fidelity - signability coefficient, inversely proportional to quality

**“modules”** panel

**Image Batch** (batch image processing)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c99f5a4a-b26f-42f6-9871-3a464f4bb73d)

 In a nutshell, this module allows you to perform group scaling of images, as well as create images based on a group of existing images using ImagePromt (ControlNet). To better understand this module, I suggest you do some experiments on your own. But I want to point out that using it allows you to use your images as references and change their style depending on the cue and the model you choose. First you need to create a zip archive with your images. The archive must not contain any subfolders, file names must not contain characters other than Latin. Upload the prepared archive to the "Upload zip file" window.

 Next, select the mode of changing the image resolution
- NOT scale - the source image resolution will not be taken into account during generation
- to ORIGINAL - this means that immediately before generation the resolution equal to the resolution of the source image will be selected.
- to OUTPUT - in this case, before generation the resolution of the source image will be changed to the generated one with preserving the proportions
  
Depending on what you want to do with the source images, select Action - Upscale or ImagePrompt. From the Method drop-down list, select the appropriate image processing method. If you are using ImagePrompt, you must also select the "Stop at" and "Weight" options.

Start batch - starts the process for execution. 

When the process is finished, click on Output->Zip button to create an archive with all previously created images from the output folder. The archive itself will appear in the "Download a Zip file" window. You can download it from there.

Clear Output - clear the output folder. It should be noted that not only the folder for the current date is cleared, but also the whole folder.


**Prompt Batch** (batch processing of prompts)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06ae0644-4e4b-4456-a92b-7699606d9ce0)

This module allows you to run generation of several hints sequentially one after another. To do this, you should fill in the table. Enter a positive hint in the hint column and a negative hint in the negative hint column respectively. Clicking the New Row button will add an empty row to the end of the table. Delete Last Row deletes the last row of the table. Start batch starts the execution of the list of prompts to generate.
You can also choose to add basic positive and negative hints.
None - no base hints will be added.
Prefix - base hints will be added before the table hints.
Suffix - basic hints will be added after hints from the table.

only positive prompts - if this item is active, all prompts in the file will be considered positive, otherwise, both positive and negative prompts will be loaded
Load prompts from file - allows to load the list of positive and negative prompts from a text file into the table. The file can have any extension

As an example, consider a file with the following contents

---- start of file -------

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750dff48-0bcc-4a20-b754-2d40f443e938)

------ end of file --------

If the item ‘only positive prompts’ is active, then the table with prompts will have the following form


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5df613e-d5c4-4088-abad-bf727f84f041)


Otherwise

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f005878-cadc-443f-a76f-7f20dda088b2)

This means that in the first case all prompts in the file are treated as positive, and empty lines are ignored.
In the second case, the file first contains a line with a positive prompt, followed by a line with a negative prompt. If you don't need to specify a negative hint, leave this line blank, but the positive hint line must always be there.

**OneButtonPrompt** - allows you to generate prompts, generate variations of your prompt and runs to generate images from them. I will not dwell on the detailed description of this module - I will only point out the main functions
   
![009](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f0005e7-1c0f-48b6-9c89-7ad1842d974e)


In the ‘Main’ tab, you can select the preset of the prompt generation theme, as well as specify unchanging prompt prefixes and suffixes.

![010](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3c65841-362e-424a-9534-9a4be605483a)


In the ‘Workflow assist’ tab you can generate 5 prompts, transfer each of them to the Fooocus prompt field and also to the Workflow field. If you select Workflow mode, it will generate not a new prompt, but variations of the prompt specified in the Workflow text field. The level of variation is selected by the engine located just below it

![011](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83f70c92-a441-4f0f-b56e-b1c236f2e407)


In this tab you can select the prompt syntax for different generation models, the length of the prompt, and enable the prompt generation enhancer.

![012](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a215a97c-155d-4e3e-a729-74cdc8393148)


This is where you can control the generation of negative prompts

![013](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f05e26cf-1c2f-4341-b3cd-5fbb9c552217)


In this tab you can start the image generation queue by generated samples. Before starting you need to specify the aspect ratio of the generated image (Size to generate), the number of generated prompts (Generation of prompts), and the models to use (Model to use).

**X/Y/Z Plot**

![019](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0392f94-8ef0-4377-a2d6-9d260ba4a20c)


This extension allows you to make image grids to make it easier to see the difference between different generation settings and choose the best option. You can change the following parameters - Styles, Steps, Aspect Ratio, Seed, Sharpness, CFG (Guidance) Scale, Checkpoint, Refiner, Clip skip, Sampler, Scheduler, VAE, Refiner swap method, Softness of ControlNet, and also replace words in the prompt and change their order

![014](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27814499-2c24-4421-a4f9-0c3503b5f66b)



This extension allows you to download models for generation from the civitai website.  To download a model you first need to specify your Civitai_API_key. In the Download Model section in the Civitai URL field you need to specify a link to the required model from the browser address bar and click Get Model Info by Civitai URL. After analysing the link you will be given information about the model. You will also be able to select the version of the model before downloading. This extension also allows you to find duplicates of downloaded models and check for updates. In addition, there is a group download option.

**TextMask**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1634a9b2-885d-49d8-a7cb-97417ed21568)

- Supports a sufficient number of fonts

How to use:
1. Upload an image
2. Add and edit the text as you like
3. Generate a mask in two clicks
4. Download and use in ControlNet (CPDS or PyraCanny) or as a mask for Inpaint to stylise text and blend into an image.

**OpenPoseEditor**

![015](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0c7d4e6-e288-41da-ba57-622bfe601551)


This module allows you to create skeletons for subsequent image creation using OpenPose ControlNet. You can also create a skeleton from an existing image.


**Photopea** - a free online analogue of Photoshop

![007](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd75f089-dee9-4c7a-a24b-2dfa5da7d2fd)

**In addition to these extensions, there are several other add-ons available**

**Select the resolution and aspect ratio of the generated image**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba5ce3d4-8f36-4f64-af82-760713c44c6a)

This setting is located in the generation resolution selection tab. Here you can select the number of horizontal and vertical points, aspect ratio. To apply the settings, click the Set button and select this resolution from the list of proposed resolutions. Your resolution will be the last one.

**Wildcard**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45a4fc1f-72f6-479a-96ea-d61b6c62333e)

This module allows you not to memorise existing files with wildcard words, but to select them directly from a list of dictionaries. You can also select directly the item you need from the list.


**OpenPose ControlNet**

![016](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79e5b10a-0fcb-40d9-8d46-ec9869725919)

Allows you to create an image based on the pose skeleton.
